# Python-101
This repository will contain sample codes on the basics of Python. It will range from Data Types to more advanced concepts in Python such as Decorators. The motivation behind this repo is to enable me to share my knowledge and enhance my learning process as I dwell deeper into these concepts.

This repo will be updated on an irregular basis. If there are any corrections or concerns, please notify me
